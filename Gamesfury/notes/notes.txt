for this project i installed.

vite (npm install vite)
bootstrap using (npm install bootstrap)
sass using (npm install -D sass)

import both bootstrap and sass in the main.jsx file:

import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
import "./SASS/main.scss";

use component scoped css for individual modules using - (drawer.module.css)

useLocaiton():
gives an obj with current path of the window.
is react-aware, updates when the route changes.
triggers re-renders of components unlike window.location.pathname.

useRef():
it points to a specific dom object, stores the data about the obj in a current obj, which does not cause the component to re-render.
can also work in place of useState, but it won't re-render the component, while useState does.

useState, useEffect, useLocation, useRef, useNavigate, useScroll, useParams

response.json()
This is an asynchronous method that you call on a Response object from fetch().

JSON.parse(response)
This is used when you already have a string, not a Response object.
